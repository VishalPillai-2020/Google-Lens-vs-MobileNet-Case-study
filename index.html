  <h3 class=" header1 col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12">Google Lens identified the mouse as itself and also gave me the correct model number of the mouse and other details <br><br> On the other hand MobileNet also gave me the correct answer 'Mouse'.  But the answer also changed onto other objects such as speakers and speaker sets. MobileNet does not focus on the specific details on the objects to give the model number or the object manufacturer name, it focuses on identifiying general objects<br><br> Google = 1 1/2, MobileNet = 1</h3>

   <h2 id="h21">Conclusion<br><br>
   Google Lens has outperformed MobileNet by 5 1/2 points. Google Lens is more Accurate Than MobileNet .  Google lens has more focus on details which helps to identify the manufacturer and other details of the object. Whereas MobileNet only identifies the objects generally without more specific details.</h2>
